 
1. I have used python for a very long time and I feel very comfortable with it along with java. I felt like this would be easy and fast in Python hence I used Python.
 
2. How do you debug a failed test in your test framework?
I open the developer tool and see why it is failing first, I will try to reproduce it and see if it makes sense to me. I will keep on stepping into the process and get a deeper view of why it failing and that is how I will debug it. 


3. What do you believe are the most common causes for instability in UI automation?
Change in xpaths, tag name, label of the ID's.


4. How do you make your tests consistent and easy to debug?
I use logger frequently so that it will tell me where it failed and would be easy for me to fix it as I would know where it failed while running the test depending on the frequency that my team would like me to run.
