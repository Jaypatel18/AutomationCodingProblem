The issue I think here is the refreshing the page that does not happen. This might be happening because of the back end issue as it should refresh the page after the user clicks on the refresh button on the top. (if using chrome). The response that I get back is 200 which means that it got updated but the front end does not show up so that is also a possible front end bug.
